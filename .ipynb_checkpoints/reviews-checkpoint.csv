review
"It was very tough decision to select between the 3 famous neckbands.
1. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2
2. Realme Wireless Buds 2 / Neo
3. Oppo Enco M32.

I did extensive research.

OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 (REJECTION POINTS):
1. No Dual Device Fast Switching.
2. Multifunctional button (Center button) is not easy to spot. We are customers, we need convenience. OnePlus should have raised the middle button so our finger can easily find it.
3. No left or right marking.
4. No rubber cover over charging port.

Realme Wireless Buds 2 / Neo (REJECTION POINTS):
1. There is no feature of switching to previous song directly with buttons (I don't want to install an app to do this basic function).
2. ANC and LDAC is marketing gimmick. Some neckbands don't say ANC but still cut out the noise.

Oppo Enco M32 (SELECTION POINTS):
1. Neckband shape is good collar type. Like you know which side is right and left.
2. The multifunctional button (Center button) can be easily spot on by your finger as it is raised.
3. Initially I thought that the U shaped ear flaps would cause pain but NO they WON'T. You can remove the flaps if you don't feel comfortable.
4. Dual Device Fast Switching works flawlessly from my laptop to phone and vice versa. You can switch even when you are wearing it. Need some practice. I wish if Oppo had given a dedicated button however believe me still it is very easy to switch by holding Vol+ and Vol - button for 2 seconds while you are wearing it.
5. Did call test to check noise cancellation by standing beside a building being destroyed by drills and hammers. My mom and wife confirmed that this Oppo Enco M32 was cancelling noise better than OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2. I did not tested Realme neckband.
6. Rubber cover to cover charging port.

Charging time: Both OnePlus Wireless Z2 and Oppo Enco M32 are getting charged 80% in 10 min. I used charger of my Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which is 33 watts 5v 3amp. At 10% charge left, I plugged the charger and in 10 min I unplugged the charger and it is 90% (Actually 80%). I follow battery golden rule: Never drain the battery completely nor charge it to full."
"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass."
"PROS:
1. Excellent call quality: there is AI noise cancellation feature, which gets activated during call. Even during heavy traffic, the person u r talking to will be hearing ur voice clearly.(my favourite feature, no other blutooth earphone comes close to this) This is like USP of bullets z2, bit ain't promoted enough bu reviewers or even company itself.

2. Excellent battery life and quick charging feature

3. Quick pairing feature ⚡ - jst keep ur device's blutooth ON , and when u seprate earpieces, ur phone will be connected to this, even before u can put those on ur ear

4. Fit is good and bad at the same time for me, when u wear them, u won't feel like ur ears r trapped or u r wearing anything, when u r not lying on bed*

CONS:
1. Little uncomfortable earpieces- i don't know why nobody mentions this thing, the earpieces r little big, so after wearing them for long time especially when u r lying on bed, then they will cause pain, i think my ear r smaller than average size.

2. Bass is little high, good for 95% of the people, but not so good to listen to classical songs as bass interference is ther. So go for oppo enco m32 if u want no compromise on sound quality and fitting issues.

3. U can only connect to 1 device at a time, why so? Even my boat rockerzz 255 i purchased on 2018 gets connected to 2 device at same time.( This is little annoying only to people who connects from pc to phone vice versa again and again, otherwise why u even need to connect to 2 devices at same time)

*****Conclusion*****

Battery life and quick charging is same in competition so not an valid reason to choose any device

Bullets z2 - if u want awesome Call quality in an Bluetooth device and are not audiophiles like 90% of the population then go for this , it will be best for u.

Enco m32- if sound quality is ur priority and want less but clean bass, to enjoy classical songs, then go for this."
"Hello Everyone,
I am writing this review for OnePlus Z2 bullets after a month of usage.
BACKGROUND - I already had a Z-bullet purchased in May 2020. It worked superb till date until somebody used it and liked it so much that the person asked me to gift it , so it had to order a new one.

OnePlus wireless neckband are no doubt one of the best in the market. Even in the price segment they are able to deliver a above par product.

PROS -
1) The RANGE has got better
2) LATENCYhas reduced. Still if you play games , you may notice some lag. Though the lag for movies had reduced a lot.
3)The neckband WEIGHT has got a bit lighter.
4) (not 100% sure) The IP RATINGS have goten better (Z2 is IP57)
5) The BATTERY has improved. What they have marketed is true. (10min charge --> greater than 15 hrs of playback)
6) Its Bluetooth 5.X
7) I am not sure if it my lack of understanding or something else. The Z control in sense of next/ prv song in the playlist was not working .This has been taken care of in Z2.

CONS :( -

1) The Neckband is NOT FLEXIBLE as was in Z version. But it is still better than realme Buds
2) The DUAL CONNECTION BUTTON is missing (A BIG LOSS). Still they have tried to provide a 'fast pair switching' (press the power buttn for 3 sec to disconnect the bluetooth connection and start afresh. I still need to have my phone/PC/tablet to make that connetion)
Z had 4 buttons. Z2 has only 3.
3) The weight is lighter as the cost of material. The ENCASING is of inferior material.

CONCLUSION - Z2 is better than Z. ONLY ONE COMPLAIN TO ONEPLUS : PLEASE PROVIDE THAT DUAL SWITCHING BUTTON...PLEASE!"
"I have used all the 3 versions of one plus Bluetooth. After Bass red edition(second version) the bass edition stopped working after 18 months. I read a review, someone described about one plus, oppo enco M31 and Boat. I brought Oppo enco M31 in January 23 used it till March23 and lost it in train during transit, So had to buy one more....being a ardent fan of one plus I thought of giving a try for latest version with12.4 drivers....
Conclusion: if u r a bass lover then go for Oppo enco M31."
"Quality build and durable. Audio quality is good with excellent bass. Using it for the past 6 months and the battery life is great.

Only con in my experience with this neckband is there is a crackling sound on the right side earpiece sometimes when you pause and replay a video.

I tried the following methods to rectify this issue:
- turning off and turning on the neck band again
- unpairing and pairing bluetooth connection
between neckband and my mobile
- turning off and turning on the Bluetooth on
my mobile.
Sometimes doing one of the above method seems to rectify the issue of crackling noise but most of the time the problem still persists.

The only solution that works for me every time is disabling the AAC audio codec mode to SBC audio codec mode in the neckband's Bluetooth settings. Atleast it works for me every time and it's either a bug in the neckband software or a design flaw.

But to be fair OnePlus neckband Bluetooth settings in my device does warm me every time when I enable the AAC audio playback that it might not work properly as intended.

So in short if you have crackling noise issues in neckband earpiece just disable AAC audio codec.
It just might work for you."
"Exceptional sound quality, comfortable fit, and user-friendly controls.
connectivity is also stable, it is a reliable and enjoyable wireless audio option.
According to me the price is little costly."
"not having an active noise cancellation, and it is not working properly...
comprively one plus Bud Z, worked very well previously"
