review
"The lead and paste is of decent quality, the price is not too high. The paste is filled in an old-fashioned container which is not really easy to open and use. For me it brought back memories of sitting in my uncle's electronic repair shop."
"Both wire and paste is of bad quality
Paste is old and dark brown in colour .
Wire is not melting properly and turned into white'ish colour instead of shining silver."
Bot the same product and very bad quality. Misleading product photos.
Average product. The combination of tin and lead is not as per standards. The solder is not of good quality.
Not upto my expectations
Fair product
The item is overpriced. The prices on the box have been scrated off by the seller seems like deciving the customer.
good product with thickness maintained
"Poor quality solder. The dried solder does not at all look like Sn60. The shine is just not there. The dried solder just looks like beads of lead. Worst part is I never tested the product when it arrived and used it only after the return window closed. Who would have thought there could be something wrong with Solder! Good learning.

The soldering paste is fine."
Not good
Value for money very good product.
Not a good product soldring time problem creating very frustrating
This is rubbish don't buy it. It dosent even melt properly. And finally after it melts when you try to solder it dries in a second the moment it touch the surface and dosent stick to the surface. It's horrible don't buy this rubbish.
Good product. But costly
Quality not so good
Value of money
U get what u have paid for.
"I bought tgis yo work with my Stanley 30 watt soldering machine.

I heated that up for 15-20 mins. It became hot but still this wire didn't melt. It's a fake wire not a wire used for soldering.

Don't buy"
Found it good one
GOOD PRODUCT
25w soldering iron not melting.
I do not an option for negative star to rank the product. The quality of product is very very poor. I even can not work or even solder a single wire on pcb. Very furstating sotuation. Could not return since I used it after return period.
Perfect
Very bad quality..!! This not 60/40 tin/lead level. Plz don't buy.
Not suitable for electronics soldering. Dry soldering problem.
Very poor quality. Had to return.
Soldering wire very poor quality
The wire was too thick for me to use
Solder wire brand is different from shown in image. Also solder paste box slightly damaged. Started return on the same day of arrival. This is the first time I got product different from ordered product.
"Worst product from Amazon. There are many scratch marks on flux box. The flux box is very sticky. Seems to be someone has opened it before my purchase. Returning the product.

Although the solder wire is good"
Good
good quality and soldering wire and soldering flux is good
Good product
Seller has scrubbed off the MRP on the product. That is not an acceptable act and is a breach of trust by the seller.
Pretty good for the cost
Fine product
"The quality of soldering wire is sooo bad , please dont buy this ..."
Value of money
Do not go for this solder wire. Perfect recipie for a dry solder.
Solder wire on flux also OK fine
Tin lead is powdering instead of melding and unworthy product.
"Not a vey good quality, probably the tin lead ratio is incorrect, doesn't sold well."
"Worst product, don't buy....ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
"This is cheating
Only soldering paste was available, no soldering wire"
Very bad product
"Dry soldering
Plz help me to buy better one"
Tin lead is not delivered which is with flux
Bad quality shoulder
Bad Quality wire...fake
Lead not delivered ðŸ˜¡
Worst ...
Good quality flux and solder wire.
A good and ideal combo at an affordable price.
"Good, value for money..."
